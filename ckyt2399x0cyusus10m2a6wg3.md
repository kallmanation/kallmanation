## Let's Re-acronym KISS

# KISS

## Keep It Simple, Stupid

Okay, no need to insult me. I get it! I'll keep my designs simple...

I'm not usually one to call things "problematic", but I do think the way we talk affects the way we think. There's no need to have a put down in one of our best pieces of advice. We're already struggling enough under our own imposter syndromes üòÖ.

## Keep It Stupid Simple

A simple transposition (_stupidly_ simple even üòè) changes our message from insulting to doubling down on itself.

Keep our designs simple ([Don't confuse simple with easy](https://dev.to/kallmanation/dear-slack-simple-is-not-what-you-think-it-is-9em)). Not just simple: **stupidly** simple! So simple we can explain them to our non-tech friends and coworkers. Simple enough that our new hire can work on the system within the week (without breaking it on misunderstandings).

**Let's re-acronym KISS from `Keep It Simple, Stupid` to `Keep It Stupid Simple`.**
