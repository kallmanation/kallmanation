## Install PWAs in Vivaldi

PWAs are coming to desktop! If you use [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) (like me), then you too can join the PWA gang.

As of today, you'll need to enable the experimental feature allowing installation by visiting [vivaldi://experiments/](vivaldi://experiments/) and checking the box:

Once that's done, visit the PWA you'd like to install, like [Google meet](https://meet.google.com). Right click the tab and in the context menu there should now be an option like "Install Google Meet...". Click it and congratulations! Welcome to the future built of Progressive Web Apps.
