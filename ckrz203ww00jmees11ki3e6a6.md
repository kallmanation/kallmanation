## TIL about the Dodecathorp

We all know and love the octothorp (`#`, aka number sign, aka hash, aka hashtag, aka pound, aka sharp, aka octothorpe with an e, aka ...).

But today, I wondered, are there other thorps? Searched it up and what do you know? [There is!](https://superuser.com/questions/1588064/does-a-dodecathorpe-unicode-character-exist) Meet the dodecathorp: 

# `â©© Dodecathorp â©©`

Next in line from the octothorp, `#`, it has three vertical and three horizontal lines: â©©.

For the curious, the next three thorps in order would be `hexadecathorp` (a 4x4 with 16 points), `icosithorp` (a 5x5 with 20 points), and `icositettarathorp` (a 6x6 with 24 points). But I haven't been able to find any unicode characters for these thorps... And if you really need a big thorp, I would choose the massive 10 by 10 `tessaracontathorp`.

![Title "Therapist: Tessaracontathorp isn't real, it can't hurt you; Tessaracontathorp:" l; Image showing ten vertical and ten horizontal black lines on a white background](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628176084110/zt-EjQaPH.jpeg)


And now I could not complete my train of thought without extending my thorps in the other direction... should the symbol with one vertical and one horizontal line (`+`) be called a `tetrathorp`? ðŸ¤”
