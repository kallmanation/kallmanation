## Unconditional FizzBuzz with only CSS

To celebrate my first 100 followers over on [dev.to](https://dev.to/kallmanation), I wanted to do a small cross-over post between my [with only CSS](https://www.kallmanation.com/series/with-only-css) series and my ["Unconditional" FizzBuzz challenge](https://www.kallmanation.com/series/unconditional-challenge). 

A solution to FizzBuzz using only CSS (and HTML); so there's _definitely_ no `if` statements here! As is tradition, I've output the first 100 FizzBuzzed numbers. My twist is that I've made it the numbering to my list of followers!

And if you're new, welcome! I'll be continuing both this with only CSS series as well as wrapping up my comparison of OOP and FP using this FizzBuzz challenge. Follow me if either of those things interest you!
